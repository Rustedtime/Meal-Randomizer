# Meal-Randomizer

This program makes it easy to plan meals for the week while keeping things fresh.

To start randomizing, simply edit the menu template to add recipes that you like to cook and run the program. The Meal Randomizer will then create a file with the meal plan and shopping list for the week. To ensure variety, the Meal Randomizer will never schedule the same entree twice in one week.
